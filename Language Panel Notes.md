Worst thing about programming languages:
========================================

SUSSMAN: the worst thing in a language is complex syntax, syntactic sugar yields cancer of the semi-colon.  It makes it difficult to write programs that write programs, or manipulate programs.

HICKEY: mutability by default.  Unlabled mutability.

???: mathematics envy

programming in source files

focus on code over the data

Dynamic scoping of symbols (totally anti-modular).

What concepts and constructs are the most important to express in a language, now and into the future
=====================

functions and data
functions as data
data as functions

How can we make things like Excel be more reusable composable etc, to make them more like 'real' languages
==========================

need to be able to get your data out of those (Excel) so that it can then be incorporated into more full-featured developer-bale  languages/systems

important not to make casual data programmer folks know about typing in the sw development sense

HICKEY: stop telling the computer how to do things: if we do that, we've now separated the idea of how to distribute / parallize things!

Which language other than your own did you wish you created
===========================================================

Lisp - introduced garbage collection, functional programming and others
Scheme
Cobol - why not, I don't think anyone's going to come up with it. Just kidding: Lisp

Its Hard to fidn People Who Want To Push Themselves, What Can we do to raise the reading/writign level of prorammers
====================================

HICKEY: don't think you solve the problem that way (though woudl be great)... but there was a time even Java devs were rare.  Actally people in power/decision spots need to make decisions to use the good stuff.

SUSSMAN: often to your advantage is to ... next to you rather than havign a better tool.  (know idea what this means)

???: better sometimes to ask forgiveness rather than permission

???: inpractice real organizations that need work don';t just pick stuff cus its nice, but bexcause they see an insurmountable problem that they need a new solution for.  Smalltlak adoption was driven by enterprises that felt they needed rich user interfaces.  They thought they needed objects to do that.  JAva was conneted to the internet, hence they picked JAva, which was supposed to be for the internet...

???: at the end of the day you have to demonstrate how the unusual knowledge you want to use, is to show people how XYZ can make them more productive.  Isnted of wining, I focused on being more productive myself, and others seeing that productivity.

Do you think the cycle of functional to OO and back and forth will continue?
============================================================================

???: that's thenature of humanity.  Thus, FOREVER.

SUSSMAN: don't think it is cyclical at all.  The technoloogy is advancing so fast that things keep changing.

???: I don't think we should be focusig on languages, but on the problems we are trying to solve.
