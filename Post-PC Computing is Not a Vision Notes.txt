Thinking about how computing is changing

Post-PC computing bugs him

World's changing so we;re maybe entering into new era of ....

Sounds like we don't know where we're going...

Welllll... we're now in the post-mainframe era of computing.

Now we enter Post-Post-Mainframe computing.

hardware doesn't define a computing era

after the 70s people really stopped counting hardware generations.  Moved on to software as the core of computing.

How are computers impacting societ?
How are they being used in our everyday lives?

...

Corporate Computing => using the power of computers to enhance what large corps could do. [50's to 70's]

Personal Computing => using individuals to empower individuals tasks [mid-late 70's]

PC Era was built  around a revolutionary vision =>  power to the people!

Ambient Computing Era
=====================

* Devices not computers
* Ubiquitous access to info
* Computer Augmented life

Immersion inside of computing

Transitional Technologies
=========================

Precusors of fundamental change
What are they ?

Every computing era has a dominant applicaiton platform

Mainframe, PC, TBD (or is it?)


Strip the unecessary from the platform for web-based ambient techs.

Mozilla Boot to Gecko
ChromeOS
Plarn/.HP WebOS
etc

Adding apis to cover the full range of hardware capabilities of devices: microphone, gyro, speaker, etc

Areas of real concern
=====================

is it possible to not have a proprietary0based platform

standards are friggin combersome -- and they suck at innovating!

who the heck will then drive the innovation?

slow rate of change

who provides the implementation?

Canonical Programming LAnguage
==============================

Corporate Computing - COBOL/Fortran/Assembly
PC Era - C
Ambient Computing Era - Javascript? (My thoughts: orrrr Javascript as the Assembly of the new era)

Why JavaScript? Because Worse is Better!
========================================

- Dick Gabriel talks, read em

- Every web application implementor has to implememnt this language?

How could you get Mozilla/MS/Google/Apple to all use your language in the browser? ...... don't see it happening?  How can it happen?

Performance: has made tremendous performance progress.

Where there's a real demand/ usage base then JS can be a very performant language.  so performance is not an issue, I don't really think.

People are doing serious computation stuff with JS

Using JS As a Virtual Machine
=============================

Amber: Smalltalk for web development - web code compiles to JS.
(My thoughts:ClojureScript!)

Evolutions of the Javascript spec.
 -- adding super
           private

Debate over syntax changes.

Clouds All the Way Down
=======================

every piece of the architecture (node) is a cloud.  Distributed.
